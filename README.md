## Usage
1. Import the project into Eclipse (Java) IDE
2. Create a mysql database called `library` on localhost with all privileges on the database granted to a user `libraryuser` with password `librarypassword`
3. Start the mysql server and run the Eclipse project

## Notes
We have combined the Java and DBMS projects into a single, simple **library management application** that demonstrates all the techniques required for both courses.
